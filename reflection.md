# Reflection Activity – Temple Experience & Spiritual Insights

Last weekend, I visited the Lisbon Portugal Temple and spent time reflecting in the celestial room. I sat quietly and allowed myself to disconnect from the rush of work, deadlines, and certifications. In that moment of stillness, I remembered the purpose behind all my striving—not just to advance a career, but to build a life aligned with the Lord's will.

## 🔹 Insights Gained

As I pondered my covenants and recent efforts in the IT 497 course, I felt clarity about a few key truths:

- **The Lord magnifies effort**, even when I feel unqualified or underprepared.
- **Spiritual strength is not separate from professional strength**; they reinforce each other.
- What brings me peace is not success or recognition, but knowing I'm trying to be useful in the Lord's hands.

I was reminded of Ether 12:27, which teaches that the Lord gives us weaknesses so we may be humble. In my preparation for AZ-304 and leadership in technical roles, I’ve often felt my limitations—but I also see how the Lord uses those very moments to teach me dependence, humility, and grace.

## 🔹 Interplay Between Spiritual and Professional Realms

Elder Bednar once compared spiritual development to intertwined strands in a rope—each one strengthening the whole. I now see my spiritual life and professional life that way. When I lead a team ethically, it’s a spiritual act. When I study cloud architecture with prayer, it becomes consecrated learning. When I help someone solve a tech problem patiently, I am not just doing a job—I am ministering in my own way.

Rather than separating “spiritual” and “career,” I’ve come to believe that one empowers the other. My testimony makes me a more compassionate leader. My temple covenants guide how I approach hard decisions. And my daily effort to be a disciple of Jesus Christ gives me a deeper reason to excel, innovate, and serve in IT.
