## Dilemma Summary:
A contractor at our company had been experiencing declining performance and was in the process of being terminated. Shortly after offboarding began, a client reported that payment information had been changed and a large amount of money was sent to cryptocurrency wallets. The contractor had unknowingly clicked a phishing link months earlier, and attackers used that access to act quickly once they knew his role was ending.

## Analysis of Actions:
- The initial failure came in long-term credential compromise detection. His account was compromised for months without notice.
- The offboarding process did not immediately revoke credentials, giving attackers a window to exploit.
- Communication about termination may have triggered the attack’s timing, but stronger internal security could have prevented it.

## Findings & Lessons Learned:
- Organizations must monitor credential activity continuously—not just reactively.
- Offboarding must include automatic revocation of all access rights to prevent misuse.
- IT professionals carry ethical responsibility not only in their personal behavior but in advocating for systems that prevent misuse of human error.
- As someone committed to disciple-leadership, this reminded me that integrity and accountability apply not just to personal behavior, but to the policies I help shape.

##  Ethical Principles and Alternative Response

### **Essential Ethical Principles Involved**
- **Responsibility**: System administrators and leaders are responsible for ensuring access controls are secure and updated.
- **Accountability**: Organizations must own and rectify weaknesses in their policies or systems that could be exploited.
- **Foresight**: Ethical behavior includes not only preventing known threats but preparing for future vulnerabilities.
- **Integrity**: Following through on secure offboarding processes and protecting client data reflects core moral and professional integrity.

### **Alternative Handling of the Situation**
Instead of waiting until after the termination meeting to begin the offboarding process, the company could have followed a **proactive, policy-based approach** that included:

1. **Immediate credential deactivation at the time of the meeting or just prior** (known as a *"just-in-time revocation"* model).
2. **Privileged access monitoring** in the weeks leading up to termination once performance declined.
3. **Email scanning and credential health monitoring** to detect signs of compromise earlier.
4. **Staggered communication** where termination details are shared internally only after access has been revoked.

### **Why This Alternative Is Better**
This approach better aligns with ethical and professional standards because:
- It **minimizes risk** to the company and client data by removing access before any potential retaliation or malicious action.
- It **respects the dignity of the contractor** by avoiding accusations while still protecting the organization.
- It **builds client trust** by showing that strong security measures are enforced even in transitional times.
- It **prevents recurrence**, turning a reactive process into a disciplined, proactive security culture.
