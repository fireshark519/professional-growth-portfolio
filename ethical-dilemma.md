Dilemma Summary:
A contractor at our company had been experiencing declining performance and was in the process of being terminated. Shortly after offboarding began, a client reported that payment information had been changed and a large amount of money was sent to cryptocurrency wallets. The contractor had unknowingly clicked a phishing link months earlier, and attackers used that access to act quickly once they knew his role was ending.

Analysis of Actions:
- The initial failure came in long-term credential compromise detection. His account was compromised for months without notice.
- The offboarding process did not immediately revoke credentials, giving attackers a window to exploit.
- Communication about termination may have triggered the attack’s timing, but stronger internal security could have prevented it.

Findings & Lessons Learned:
- Organizations must monitor credential activity continuously—not just reactively.
- Offboarding must include automatic revocation of all access rights to prevent misuse.
- IT professionals carry ethical responsibility not only in their personal behavior but in advocating for systems that prevent misuse of human error.
- As someone committed to disciple-leadership, this reminded me that integrity and accountability apply not just to personal behavior, but to the policies I help shape.
