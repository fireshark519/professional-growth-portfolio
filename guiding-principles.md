## Gratitude & Prayerful Dependence on God
As I continue preparing for my AZ-304 certification, I’ve noticed that consistent prayer brings not just focus, but a feeling of calm assurance. The Lord doesn’t just help me retain technical knowledge—He helps me face anxiety with faith. This dependence, far from being a weakness, is one of my greatest strengths. I’ve also come to see gratitude as a leadership trait. When I acknowledge the contributions of others, whether in a team stand-up or a support meeting, I strengthen relationships and build trust.
