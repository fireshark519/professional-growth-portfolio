# Week 5 – Usability Testing and Ethical Reflection Report

## Usability Testing Report & Portfolio Enhancements

### Testing Approach
To evaluate the usability of my GitHub Pages portfolio, I conducted informal testing with two colleagues from my current workplace:
- **Poornima Jaganathan**
- **Ashish Badge**

Each reviewer was asked to:
- Navigate to all sections via the `README.md`
- Locate my résumé, ethical dilemma, and projects
- Evaluate readability, clarity, and ease of navigation on both desktop and mobile devices

### Feedback Summary
- Positive comments on clarity of file structure and project narratives  
- Suggestions to improve visibility of résumé and video links  
- Recommendation to make section headers more distinct and standardized across files

### Enhancements Made
- Updated navigation and link labels in `README.md`  
- Standardized Markdown formatting across all portfolio files (headers, spacing, emphasis)  
- Tested responsiveness across phone and tablet devices to ensure readability  
- Added clear section labels and emphasized spiritual reflections  
- Labeled and linked the video reflection more visibly

### Reflection
This usability review process reminded me that **user empathy** is an essential part of technical leadership. As a disciple-leader, I want my work to be clear, accessible, and purposeful. Designing with the user in mind is a way of serving them—especially when showcasing both spiritual values and technical accomplishments.
