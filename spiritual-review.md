# Spiritual Integration and Review – Week 5 Reflection

As I approach the final stages of building my IT 497 Capstone portfolio, I’ve been reflecting deeply on how Christlike attributes and personal awareness guide my growth as both a disciple and a professional.

## Christlike Attributes in My Life and Portfolio

Three qualities stand out as transformative influences in both my faith and IT career:

1. **Faith and Dependence on the Savior** – As Sister Kusch illustrated in *A Full Measure of Faith*, faith isn't just belief—it’s acting on trust even when the outcome is unclear. Preparing for the AZ-304 certification, I began every study session with prayer. This ritual wasn't about passing a test—it was about acknowledging my dependence on divine help, even in professional development.

2. **Understanding Through Action** – President Kusch reminded me that true understanding comes not just from study, but from experience and prayer. I've applied this by revising parts of my portfolio to reflect not only what I know, but what I’ve lived—especially in the ethical dilemma and project narratives. These show how I strive to “walk uprightly” as taught in Proverbs 15:21.

3. **Compassionate Integrity** – From Elder Christofferson’s “Doctrine of Belonging” to President Nelson’s call to avoid contention, I’ve learned that being a Christlike leader means promoting inclusion, trust, and peace. In reviewing my leadership experiences in support teams, I’ve made space for those values in how I describe my technical contributions.

## Personal Warning Signs and Spiritual Course Correction

I’ve noticed certain warning signs that signal when I’m spiritually off track:
- Relying too heavily on my own strength without prayer  
- Viewing tasks only as checkboxes rather than opportunities to serve  
- Feeling frustration instead of patience when under pressure

When these signs surface, I realign by:
- Returning to scripture and temple worship  
- Making space for reflection, especially through journaling  
- Asking myself if I am trying to control the outcome, rather than trusting Christ to “author my story” (Camille N. Johnson)

## Cohesion and Finalization Goals

After reviewing all portfolio components:
- I’ve **tightened formatting** to improve readability  
- I’ve **ensured spiritual reflections appear across all files**, not just isolated in `reflection.md`  
- I’ve added **links and scripture summaries** to improve context and engagement  
- My **ethical dilemma** now includes a clearly stated alternative and principles-based resolution

I feel my portfolio is more than a course assignment—it’s a testimony of how faith and professionalism intertwine. I plan to maintain and grow it as a living document long after this course ends.
