Welcome to my professional portfolio. I’m Roberto Correia, an IT professional with over eight years of experience in technical support leadership, application support, and system troubleshooting. Through this portfolio, I aim to showcase not only my technical competencies but also how my spiritual values—gratitude, integrity, and service—shape my approach to leadership, learning, and ethical responsibility in the IT field. Each project and experience featured here reflects both professional growth and my commitment to disciple-leadership.
