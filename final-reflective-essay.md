# Final Reflective Essay: Portfolio Alignment and Goal Evolution

As I reach the final stage of the IT 497 Capstone experience, I’ve taken time to reflect on how this portfolio has aligned with the goals I set at the beginning of the course and how those goals have evolved. This reflection has been an important part of closing the loop on a semester of both spiritual and professional growth.

## Initial SMART Goals

At the outset, I established three core SMART goals:
1. **Integrate two spiritually grounded reflections into project narratives.**
2. **Add two technical projects to my portfolio with meaningful commentary on leadership or ethical principles.**
3. **Begin studying for the AZ-304 certification, logging 10 hours and incorporating relevant skills into my documentation.**

These goals were realistic but aspirational. They were designed to combine practical IT development with my spiritual values of integrity, gratitude, and service.

## Evidence of Alignment

### ✔️ Goal 1: Spiritual Reflections in Projects
In `projects.md` and `project-mbio.md`, I reflected deeply on how spiritual principles guided my choices in technical leadership roles. For example:
- In the migration project, I wrote about prayerful dependence and humility during a high-stakes deadline.
- In the report logic task, I emphasized the importance of integrity in resisting rushed, unscalable solutions.

These were not surface-level tie-ins. They were moments where spiritual habits directly supported my technical execution.

### ✔️ Goal 2: Ethical & Technical Project Integration
I documented two major projects, each with a different focus:
- One explored technical leadership under deadline pressure.
- The other focused on ethical foresight, system design, and user protection.

Feedback from peers also helped me expand the ethical dimensions of my `ethical-dilemma.md` file. I implemented their suggestions to make my analysis more robust and spiritually reflective.

### ✔️ Goal 3: AZ-304 Study and Integration
While I have not yet taken the certification exam, I’ve exceeded the 10-hour study mark and used my learning to inform portfolio elements. For example:
- The password/hash generation tool I built ties directly into AZ-304 security principles.
- I included future goals to complete the exam in my `final-action-plan.md`.

## How My Goals Evolved

Midway through the course, my perspective shifted. I initially saw the portfolio as a showcase of competence. But through spiritual reflections, peer collaboration, and temple-focused assignments, I came to see it as a spiritual offering as well.

- My goals evolved from “documenting projects” to “documenting discipleship.”
- I began to focus more on **how** I work—ethically, prayerfully, patiently—rather than just **what** I produce.

This evolution shows up in the structure of my files. Every `.md` file includes not just facts, but reflections. This balance mirrors the balance I strive for in real life.

## Final Takeaway

This portfolio has become more than an academic task. It is a **living document** that tracks how I apply faith in my career and leadership. My initial goals served as a scaffold, but what grew on top of them was something more holistic: a testimony in the language of technology.

I plan to continue using this portfolio—not only to track skills and projects—but to remind myself why I serve, lead, and create.
