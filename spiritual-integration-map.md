# Week 5 – Spiritual Integration Mental Map Reflection

## 🧠 Mental Map: Integrating Christ’s Teachings with Professional Practice

This reflection is inspired by my recent visit to the temple and time spent pondering how Christlike attributes shape who I am as a disciple and a professional in IT. Below is a conceptual "mental map" that outlines my key insights.

---

### 🌿 Center: Jesus Christ – The Source of Strength and Alignment

Everything branches out from Christ’s example. His humility, leadership, compassion, and moral courage are the foundation I want in my life and work.

---

### 🔁 Branch 1: Dependence on God (Gratitude & Prayer)

- **Temple Insight**: I recognized that every meaningful step I’ve taken—professionally and spiritually—has come after prayer and submission to God’s will.
- **Application**: I now make it a practice to begin major work decisions, projects, and study sessions with prayer. It grounds me in purpose.

---

### 🔐 Branch 2: Moral Courage in Complexity

- **Temple Insight**: Integrity is tested in private decisions more than public ones.
- **Application**: In IT roles with data access and admin rights, I’ve seen how systems can either tempt shortcuts or uphold virtue. I aim to design with guardrails that support good decisions.

---

### 🤝 Branch 3: Service is Leadership

- **Temple Insight**: Service isn't limited to Church callings—it thrives in the workplace.
- **Application**: Mentoring a junior developer, documenting support processes, or helping a client understand a system—these are my modern forms of discipleship.

---

### 🧭 Branch 4: Constant Course Correction

- **Temple Insight**: The covenant path includes repentance, reflection, and realignment.
- **Application**: I’ve created a practice of weekly journaling on what’s gone well and what needs alignment—both in faith and in project execution. This helps me lead with clarity and peace.

## Final Thought

Attending the temple helped me see that my portfolio isn’t just a career summary—it’s a spiritual testimony in digital form. Integrating Christ’s teachings means I don’t need to compartmentalize who I am at work and who I am at church. I can be whole, consistent, and purposeful.
