## Dilemma Summary:
A contractor at our company had been experiencing declining performance and was in the process of being terminated. Shortly after offboarding began, a client reported that payment information had been changed and a large amount of money was sent to cryptocurrency wallets. The contractor had unknowingly clicked a phishing link months earlier, and attackers used that access to act quickly once they knew his role was ending.

## Analysis of Actions:
- The initial failure came in long-term credential compromise detection. His account was compromised for months without notice.
- The offboarding process did not immediately revoke credentials, giving attackers a window to exploit.
- Communication about termination may have triggered the attack’s timing, but stronger internal security could have prevented it.

## Findings & Lessons Learned:
- Organizations must monitor credential activity continuously—not just reactively.
- Offboarding must include automatic revocation of all access rights to prevent misuse.
- IT professionals carry ethical responsibility not only in their personal behavior but in advocating for systems that prevent misuse of human error.
- As someone committed to disciple-leadership, this reminded me that integrity and accountability apply not just to personal behavior, but to the policies I help shape.

##  Ethical Principles and Alternative Response

### **Essential Ethical Principles Involved**
- **Responsibility**: System administrators and leaders are responsible for ensuring access controls are secure and updated.
- **Accountability**: Organizations must own and rectify weaknesses in their policies or systems that could be exploited.
- **Foresight**: Ethical behavior includes not only preventing known threats but preparing for future vulnerabilities.
- **Integrity**: Following through on secure offboarding processes and protecting client data reflects core moral and professional integrity.

### **Alternative Handling of the Situation**
Instead of waiting until after the termination meeting to begin the offboarding process, the company could have followed a **proactive, policy-based approach** that included:

1. **Immediate credential deactivation at the time of the meeting or just prior** (known as a *"just-in-time revocation"* model).
2. **Privileged access monitoring** in the weeks leading up to termination once performance declined.
3. **Email scanning and credential health monitoring** to detect signs of compromise earlier.
4. **Staggered communication** where termination details are shared internally only after access has been revoked.

### **Why This Alternative Is Better**
This approach better aligns with ethical and professional standards because:
- It **minimizes risk** to the company and client data by removing access before any potential retaliation or malicious action.
- It **respects the dignity of the contractor** by avoiding accusations while still protecting the organization.
- It **builds client trust** by showing that strong security measures are enforced even in transitional times.
- It **prevents recurrence**, turning a reactive process into a disciplined, proactive security culture.

## Spiritual Reflection

This experience reaffirmed my commitment to Integrity and Moral Courage. As a disciple-leader, I see ethics not just as policy compliance, but as stewardship over the systems and data I manage.


## Week 5 Reflection: Ethical Foresight in Future Practice

This dilemma has helped me see that ethical leadership in IT is not limited to identifying wrongdoing—it’s about designing systems that reduce the chance for mistakes or exploitation. In future roles, I plan to:

- **Prioritize automation and timing in access control**, ensuring that terminations are always paired with instant revocation of credentials.
- **Implement early-warning systems** for unusual credential behavior, even before someone is flagged for HR-related concerns.
- **Encourage policy reviews after every incident**, not to assign blame, but to proactively prevent recurrence.
- **Normalize ethical conversations** within the IT team to promote accountability and foresight, especially around offboarding, data access, and vendor/client transitions.

This assignment reinforced for me that true disciple-leaders plan with foresight, act with compassion, and protect others—even behind the scenes in system design. Ethical foresight is not just a professional discipline; it's a spiritual one.
