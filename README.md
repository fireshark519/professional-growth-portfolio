## ðŸ“… Week 4 Summary

During Week 4, several updates and refinements were made across this portfolio:

- **Expanded spiritual materials** and added detailed summaries/reflections directly into `guiding-principles.md` and `reflection.md`
- **Updated project files** to reflect ethical integration and technical improvements (`projects.md` and `project-mbio.md`)
- **Added agency-based reflection video** to `reflection.md` tied to Doctrine and Covenants 58:26â€“28
- **Improved formatting** across all `.md` files for clarity and readability (headings, spacing, link formatting, and structure)
- Incorporated **peer review feedback** into the MB.IO project summary with clear documentation of refinements and ethical considerations

These updates align with rubric expectations for spiritual-professional alignment, communication quality, and project depth.
