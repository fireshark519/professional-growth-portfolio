Guiding Principle 1: Gratitude & Prayerful Dependence on God
Scripture: Ether 12:27 – “If men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness.”
Link: (https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng&id=p27#p27)
Summary: This scripture teaches that recognizing our weaknesses can be a divine invitation to humility. The Lord gives us weakness so we can learn to depend on Him, and as we exercise faith, those weaknesses can become strengths.
Reflection: During my AZ-304 certification prep, I often felt overwhelmed. I began to pray before each study session—not just for help remembering the content, but for peace. Those moments reminded me that I don’t walk this journey alone. That sense of spiritual focus became a tool for both learning and resilience.
Talk: Invite Christ to Author Your Story – Camille N. Johnson

Summary: Sister Johnson encourages us to stop trying to control our lives so tightly and instead allow the Savior to be the author of our stories.
Reflection: I often feel the need to plan every step of my career. This talk taught me to ask not just, “What do I want?”, but “What does the Lord want for me?” It’s helped me open my heart to divine timing and trust that setbacks might be part of a bigger design.
Guiding Principle 2: Integrity and Moral Courage
Scripture: D&C 121:41–42 – “No power or influence can or ought to be maintained... only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness...”
Link: (https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/liahona/2011/06/youth/doctrine-and-covenants-121-41-43?lang=eng)
Summary: These verses redefine leadership not as control but as stewardship through Christlike attributes. They emphasize that integrity and humility must be the foundation of righteous influence.
Reflection: In IT, where admin access and client data can easily be abused or mishandled, I’ve learned that trust is everything. I’ve been in situations where the right choice wasn’t easy or popular—but it was ethical. These verses inspire me to lead not just with technical authority, but with patience, kindness, and moral clarity.
Talk: The Way of the Disciple – President Dieter F. Uchtdorf
Link: https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2009/04/the-way-of-the-disciple?lang=eng
Summary: President Uchtdorf reminds us that discipleship isn’t loud or flashy. It’s shown in everyday integrity and quiet devotion.
Reflection: This talk helps me stay consistent in my actions, even when no one is watching. Whether I’m writing secure code or mentoring a peer, I try to reflect the Savior in how I act, not just in what I say.
Guiding Principle 3: Service and Building the Kingdom
Scripture: Mosiah 2:17 – “When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.”
Link: (https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2?lang=eng)
Summary: This verse highlights that every small act of service is sacred. It transforms the ordinary into the eternal.
Reflection: I used to see tech work as just solving problems. Now I realize that even helping a coworker debug an issue or building a tool that makes someone’s day easier is service. I try to look for ways I can uplift others with my skills, not just perform tasks.
Talk: Let God Prevail – President Russell M. Nelson
Link: https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2020/10/46nelson?lang=eng
Summary: President Nelson urges us to let God take the lead in our lives and to make ourselves available to do His work.
Reflection: This talk challenges me to be more intentional in how I use my talents. Instead of chasing only recognition or success, I try to ask, “How can I use this project, this job, this skill—to serve?”
