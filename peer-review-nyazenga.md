## ‚úÖ What I Really Liked

### 1. Clear Spiritual Depth + Technical Skill  
Your guiding principles (Integrity, Seek Learning by Faith, and Service) show up everywhere‚Äîyour Python scripts, Power BI dashboards, even your usability choices. The way you wove in small prayers before debug sessions and how that affected your clarity was powerful and relatable.

### 2. Ethical Thinking That‚Äôs Actionable  
I was impressed by your handling of the admin password breach. You didn‚Äôt just analyze what went wrong‚Äîyou gave a thoughtful, fair, and spiritually grounded solution. I especially liked that you mentioned the spiritual cost of shortcuts and how security can be a form of service.

### 3. Project Detail + Reflection  
The AWS migration work for Oryx Dry Cleaners was super detailed. You clearly refined the project with stakeholder feedback, security concerns, and cost estimates. The way you connected multi-language support to fairness and ethics was a highlight.

## üîß Suggestions

### - Maybe Reduce Paragraph Lengths  
Some slides or sections had dense paragraphs. Breaking those into smaller chunks (with bolded headers or icons) could make it even easier to read, especially for non-technical users.

### - Highlight Outcomes in One-Line Summaries  
You mention some great outcomes‚Äîlike 99.99% uptime or 18% cost increase for better security. Maybe consider calling those out in bold bullets or quick stats at the top of each project page to help readers scan key wins.

## ‚≠ê Final Thoughts

You built a deeply personal, technically strong, and spiritually rich portfolio. You reflect Christlike leadership not just in your projects but in how you document them. This is more than a capstone‚Äîit's a testimony through technology. Great job.
