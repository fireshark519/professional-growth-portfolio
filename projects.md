## Project: VB.NET/C# Debugging – NetRefer
Role: Tech Support Lead
Technologies: VB.NET, C#, application support
Outcome: Led resolution of high-severity bugs and supported junior team members during critical support escalations.
**Spiritual Reflection:** Practicing patience and humility helped me stay calm under pressure, lead by example, and handle escalations with compassion and clarity.
##  Project 1: High-Stakes Client Migration (NetRefer)

**Project:**  Project Summary
This project involved migrating a large-scale client with **16 individual brands**, far exceeding the usual 3–4 brand structure we typically handled. It required significant customization and data coordination under tight deadlines. The client had a contractual "easy out" clause—any misstep could cost the company millions. Success would not only secure a multi-million-dollar deal but also set a reusable framework for **three upcoming migrations** with similar complexity.

**Project:**  Technical Contributions
- Developed a **custom password and hash generation tool** for bulk user account provisioning
- Ensured data integrity across thousands of records using rigorous QA validations
- Helped establish a scalable framework for **future migrations of 16–20 brand clients**

**Project:**  Spiritual Reflection
This project challenged both my patience and resilience. My guiding principle of **Gratitude & Prayerful Dependence on God** became crucial. I often paused to pray before major pushes, especially when stress peaked. The workload was immense, but through constant dependence on the Lord, I found moments of clarity that helped me complete tasks quickly and correctly. I’m deeply grateful for how this experience sharpened my leadership and technical problem-solving.

##  Project 2: Reusable Reporting Logic for Core Client (NetRefer)

**Project:**  Project Summary
Our largest client requested a new logic model for financial reporting—a flexible solution that would be implemented across multiple complex reports. The challenge was not just making the logic accurate in SQL, but ensuring it was **modular, maintainable, and scalable**. It had to be reusable to minimize duplication in future builds.

**Project:**  Technical Contributions
- Designed and implemented complex **SQL logic** to meet new reporting requirements
- Ensured the code was modular and **easily reusable** for similar reports
- Collaborated with the internal team to integrate logic into the broader reporting engine

**Project:**  Spiritual Reflection
This project tied closely to my principle of **Integrity and Moral Courage**. There was pressure to "make it work fast" and patch pieces together, but I knew that would create tech debt. Instead, I stood by the importance of a clean, scalable solution—even if it took longer. My choice to do it right, not just fast, reflected my belief that spiritual principles apply just as much to code as to conduct.
