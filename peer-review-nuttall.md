## ‚úÖ Strengths

### 1. Deep Spiritual Integration  
J. Nuttall‚Äôs portfolio reflects a powerful synthesis of technical growth and spiritual conviction. The principles of humility, discipleship, and strength through adversity are not only stated but lived out across project reflections and professional experiences.

### 2. Compelling Ethical Narrative  
The ethical dilemma section was one of the strongest parts of this portfolio. It explored both the technical violation and the spiritual impact of professional integrity. The alternative approach proposed showed foresight and a commitment to accountability and user consent.

### 3. Action Plan & Future Orientation  
Both the spiritual and professional development goals were realistic, well-structured, and inspired by gospel values. There is a clear sense of continued discipleship beyond the classroom setting.

## üõ† Suggestions for Improvement

### 1. Visual Anchoring for Long Text Sections  
Some pages (especially the reflections and scripture insights) could benefit from added formatting like bolded scripture headers or icons to break up text. This would help readers digest rich content more easily, especially on mobile.

### 2. Showcase of Project Deliverables  
The projects were clearly described, but adding a small screenshot or visual from one of the PowerShell scripts or dashboards would strengthen the professional impact, especially for technical audiences.
